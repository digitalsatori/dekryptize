DEKRYPTIZE
==========

2016-12-19  Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen <mjos@iki.fi>

Dekryptize is a command line ncurses animation thing that makes decryption
look like, well, decryption. The plaintext input is read from standard input --
or if a filename is supplied, from that file.

For additional effect, wear a black hoodie and sunglasses to your demo
and use a hacky desktop environment, like Kali Linux (remember, root=toor). 

Created one afternoon at a salary-paying workplace in a response to a demo
requirement from the marketing department.

Cheers,
